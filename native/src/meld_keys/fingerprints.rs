/// Computes a `Fingerprint` from a `Primitive`.
///
/// A fingerprint needs to be independent of triangle order and vertex order, and obviously it
/// should be non-trivially different from the fingerprint of some other `Primitive`. This isn't
/// as obvious as it seems: for example, if we simply took the geometric average of positions,
/// all shapes that are symmetric around origin, regardless of scale, would be identical.
///
/// We look at vertex positions and vertex colours, and simply add them up, with an added
/// skew to the Y and Z dimensions, to break symmetries.
///
/// More complexity could be added here, if warranted.
